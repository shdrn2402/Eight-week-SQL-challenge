# Eight week SQL challenge

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for the created by Danny Maa [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), featuring eight unique case studies. It highlights my SQL skills, demonstrating my ability to tackle diverse challenges and showcasing expertise in query design and problem-solving. The case studies cover topics such as ranking, common table expressions (CTEs), date and time functions, text processing, aggregation, handling NULL values, and more.

The repository represents the culmination of my experience in solving various SQL challenges. Each case study presents a distinct scenario that required applying a wide range of SQL techniques, including CTEs, conditional statements, date functions, and advanced aggregations. This process has greatly enhanced my ability to write efficient queries, manipulate data, and approach problems analytically.

Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my capability to solve complex SQL challenges and effectively address real-world data problems. It reflects my growth, technical expertise, and innovative approach to working with SQL.
