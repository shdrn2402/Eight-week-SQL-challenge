**\*Note**:
1.  **Primary Key Absence:**
    * Primary keys are intentionally omitted for this educational dataset.
    * This is acceptable due to the static and artificially generated nature of the data.
    * **In production, primary keys are crucial for data integrity and uniqueness.**

2.  **Data Type Inconsistencies:**
    * Inserted values may not match column data types (e.g., string values in INTEGER columns).
    * While PostgreSQL performs implicit conversions, **explicit type casting is recommended for production to ensure data consistency and prevent errors.**

    -   Joins the `events` table (aliased as `e`) with the `page_hierarchy` table (aliased as `ph`) using the common column `page_id` to link events to page names.
-   `WHERE e.event_type = 1`:
    -   Filters the events to include only those where `event_type` is equal to `1`. This assumes that `event_type = 1` represents page view events. **You might need to adjust this value based on your actual data.**
-   `GROUP BY ph.page_name`:
    -   Groups the results by `page_name` so that the `COUNT()` function aggregates views for each unique page.
-   `ORDER BY view_count DESC`:
    -   Orders the grouped results in descending order based on the `view_count`, placing the pages with the most views at the top.
-   `LIMIT 3`:
